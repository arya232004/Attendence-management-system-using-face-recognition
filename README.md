The Attendance Management System using Face Recognition is a software application that uses facial recognition technology to mark attendance in real-time. It is a user-friendly application that allows users to take attendance with the click of a button.

The proposed attendance management system using face recognition technology that updates data in an Excel sheet aims to overcome the limitations of the existing system while still retaining its advantages. This system could be designed to be cost-effective by using readily available hardware and software, and to improve accuracy by using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, even in challenging lighting conditions or with changes to facial features. Data security and privacy could be ensured through the use of encryption and access controls, and redundancy measures could be put in place to prevent data loss in the event of technical issues. This system is specifically designed to be used in labs to keep track of individual's attendance
